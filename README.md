# VELD.CHAT PC CLIENT - REVISION 1

## Overview

This is the official revision of the original veld.chat repo because it would have been a pain in the ass too replace all the files manually in github

## New features

- You can send messages now, still working on reading them and drawing them to display
- Now you need to log in with your token before you can access the chat

## Installation and the like

Download the latest binary release to see the magic and stuff

## Have fun :D
